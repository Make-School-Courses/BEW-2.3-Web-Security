## 🌴 [10m] BREAK

## 💻 [50m] In Class Activity: BYOB

Introduce the [Build Your Own Botnet](https://github.com/malwaredllc/byob) framework and the class project using the framework. Rubric and details to come!

Students may also opt to truly build their own bot, and simply use the framework as a guide.

Use this time to investigate the framework and scaffold out your final project, due on the last day of class.
